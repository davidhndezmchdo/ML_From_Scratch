# ML_From_Scratch
Welcome to my repository where I've recreated famous machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. In this repository, you'll find implementations of various machine learning algorithms.
I'd like to thank AssemblyAI for providing the tutorials and tools needed for the recreation of these algorithms.


### Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you'll need:
- Python
- Numpy

### Installation
You can clone this repository using Git:

## Project Structure
Briefly describe the structure of your project and how it's organized.

## Implemented Algorithms
Here's a list of machine learning algorithms that I've implemented in this repository:

1. KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Naive Bayes
7. PCA (Principal component analysis)
8. Perceptron
9. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
10. Kmeans (K-means clustering)
Feel free to explore and use them for your own projects.
